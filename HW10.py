import random

#1. Print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World")
#2. Create 3 variables that each randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, named A, B, and C.
a= random.randint(1,10)

b= random.randint(1,10)

c= random.randint(1,10)
#3. Print A, B, and C on the same line.
print(a,b,c)
#4. Make an if statement that prints if variable A is greater than, less than, or equal to 5.
if a>5:
    print("a is greater than 5.")
elif a<5:
    print("a is less than 5.")
elif a==5:
    print("a is equal to 5.")
#5. Make an if statement that prints if variable B is between 3 and 7, or not.
if b<7 and b>3:
    print("b is between 3 and 7.")
else:print("b is not between 3 and 7.")
#6. Make an if statement that prints if variable C is even or odd.
if c%2==0:
    print("c is even.")
else:print("c is odd.")
#7. Create a variable whose value is 3 + a randomly generated number between 1 and 20
d= 3+(random.randint(1,20))
print(d)

#8. Make an if statement that prints if the variable from #7 is greater than, less than, or equal to A + B + C.
e=a+b+c
print(e)
if d<e :
    print("d is less than e.")
elif d>e :
    print("d is greater than e.")
else:
    print("d is equal to e.")
